// composer-state.ts — the Shared Composer's pure state core (B4.0 + B4.1).
//
// No React, no DOM, no I/O — so it is unit-testable under the node vitest
// harness (`tests/**/*.test.ts`). The React wrappers (ComposerProvider,
// ComposerHost, ResMenu) are thin shells over the pieces defined here:
//
//   • ComposerState / composerReducer  — the singleton open/close state the
//     provider drives via useReducer.
//   • composerPropsFrom                — the opts → ResourceComposerProps
//     mapping the host uses to render the EXISTING ResourceComposer verbatim.
//   • resMenuOpenUrl                   — the isSafeUrl-gated URL every ResMenu
//     open/copy path consults (the single shipped sink; no new sink).
//
// Types are pulled from the existing ResourceComposer via `import type`, which
// is erased at compile time — so this module (and its tests) never load the
// heavy client component. That also LOCKS the opts shape to the component's
// real props: if ResourceComposerProps changes, `ComposerOpenOptions` and
// `composerPropsFrom` fail to type-check rather than drifting silently.

import type { ResourceComposerProps } from "@/components/daily/ResourceComposer";

// ── openComposer options ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every field maps 1:1 onto a ResourceComposerProps field. Two are handled by
// the host, not the caller:
//   • `open`    — the host injects `true` (the composer only exists in state
//                 while it should be open; closing clears the state entirely).
//   • `onClose` — the caller's `onClose` is OPTIONAL here; the host always
//                 composes it with the provider's `closeComposer` so the
//                 singleton state is cleared no matter how the dialog closes.

//
// The shared resource action menu's inputs. Open / Open-in-new-tab / Copy-link
// are derived from `resource.url` through {@link resMenuOpenUrl} (the isSafeUrl
// sink); Edit / Remove are caller callbacks that render only when supplied.
